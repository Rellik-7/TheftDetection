If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.float64` here.\n","Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations\n","  This is separate from the ipykernel package so we can avoid doing imports until\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"m0CEilHEi7_M","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655293755252,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Abhranil Das","userId":"16950397574706583878"}},"outputId":"72043203-f494-415f-c467-b3485cdfb2ec"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Detected', '87.51553297042847 %']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":147}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["inputs = gr.Video(source = 'upload', label = 'Input video', show_label =  True)\n","outputs = [gr.Textbox(label = 'Violence', show_label = True),\n","           gr.Textbox(label = 'Percentage Accuracy', show_label = True)]\n","demo = gr.Interface(fn = detect_violence, \n","                    inputs = inputs, \n","                    outputs = outputs,\n","                    title = 'Violence Detection Using Conv2D + LSTM Model'\n","                    )\n","demo.launch(share = True)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":730},"id":"wPT4HffIvQEg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655294257499,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4365,"user":{"displayName":"Abhranil Das","userId":"16950397574706583878"}},"outputId":"11ce61d1-6b85-4fbf-c1f0-1d7af0029d7c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Colab notebook detected.
